# Solar-Tracker
The following software has been prepared to create a simple interface to control small servos and perform electrical load measurements using the INA219 chip. 
Ultimately, the code was prepared for the Arduino UNO board, but even a smaller platform should handle it without any problems.

## Installation

To set the things up, you have to open terminal in project directory and write:

```bash
  source env/bin/activate
```

After that, all you have to do is run this comand:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
